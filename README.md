# afs-test

## Details

This is a Vue 2 project with TS using these libraries for component setup:
```vue-class-component```
```vue-property-decorator```

## Assignments

### table row
On the "Home" page is a table, add a row to this table that displays the totals of the other rows.

### Async/Await
In the mounted function the data for the table is being fetched, edited and placed in the tableData property with a promise chain. 
Rewrite this function but instead of chaining promises use async/await to do the exact same. 

### Add a security class
On the home page, create a button that opens a modal window containing a form. This form should allow you to add a security class to the table, updating the totals.

### Transfer search
On the Transfers page you find a list of financial transfers with a search bar. Make the transferlist searchable by "recordDate".

### Style the transferRow.vue component
Rework the style for this component, using this design. Make it look as close as possible.  
The texts in the design and the provided data do not match. It is just about recreating the design.

If you for whatever reason do not have a similar result to the image, please let us know when you send in the work.

### Fix the update transfers button
Something is going wrong with this button, fix it and explain why it broke in the comments.
